 Directories: In Amazon S3, directories are represented as prefixes in object keys. For example, an object with the key dir1/ represents a directory named dir1. When listing objects with a delimiter (typically /), S3 groups objects that share the same prefix up to the first occurrence of the delimiter, effectively simulating a directory structure.

    Files: Files are represented by their object keys without a trailing delimiter. For instance, file1.txt is a file at the top level of the bucket.

How the Service Works:

    Listing Top-Level Contents: When the endpoint /list-bucket-content is accessed without a specified path, the service lists all objects at the top level of the S3 bucket. It uses the delimiter / to group objects by their prefixes, identifying directories and files.

    Listing Contents of a Specific Directory: When a path is specified (e.g., /list-bucket-content/dir1), the service lists all objects under that prefix. It again uses the delimiter / to group objects, effectively listing the contents of the specified directory.
